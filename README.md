## General info
The idea to create a given solution appeared while working in the company - DPD. Many problems have been noticed, among others no communication with the courier and no information regarding the reason why the parcel was not delivered to the indicated address, but only to the Pickup point.

The mobile application supports the work of couriers and streamlines the operations of the DPD courier company. The application is designed for mobile devices with the Android system.

The application provides the location of couriers with a delivery package for clients of courier companies. The application also allows you to check courier information, such as the courier's phone number or car description (for faster identification of the courier in the field) and (soon) sending messages to the courier via the built-in chat. The courier in his panel can manage his packages for delivery, i.e. add or remove delivery addresses from the map and start / stop sharing his location with the customer.
